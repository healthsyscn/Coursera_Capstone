# Austin Neighborhood Restaurant Preferences

## Introduction
A local meal delivery service is trying to determine how to customize their offerings and stock their local distribution points by neighborhood. They want to understand which products may sell better in a certain neighborhood and adjust their inventory at the distrubiation point responsible for that area. To do so, they would be interested in seeing the types of restaurants in each neighborhood and see if there are any groups of neighborhoods that have similar preferences. 

## Data
The geospatial data used for this research comes from city of [Austin Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/). A file containing the boundaries of all of the neighborhoods within the city limits can be found on a page of the portal under *[Boundaries: Austin Neighborhood Planning Areas](https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Boundaries-Austin-Neighborhood-Planning-Areas/nz5f-3t2e)*. The boundary data was then converted to longitude and latitude coordinates using [MyGeoData Cloud](https://mygeodata.cloud/). Once loaded into a dataframe, unneceesary columns were dropped, and columns were renamed, leaving only the name, latitude, and longitude of each of the 65 neighbohoods. 

The restaurant data comes from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/developer/). To gather the needed data, we will run query the [Venue Search endpoint](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference/venues/search/) and specify the *Food* categoy ID (4d4b7105d754a06374d81259) with a radius of approxamtely 1 mile (1600m) of each neighborhood coordinate to limit our results to just restaurants in each area. This will return results such as this restaurant [here](https://foursquare.com/v/pinthouse-pizza/562e6fc3498e291ae03ab4be) which would be categorized as a pizza place. The data in the response will be parsed just for the category and it will be associated with the neighborhood. Ambiguous restaurant categories such as 'Food Truck','Restaurant','Food','Food Stand', and 'Cafeteria' will be removed from the dataset.
